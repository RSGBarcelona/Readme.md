# RSG-BCN 

## How this works:
- The [Learning_Club folder]() is destined to storage the presentations and other related resources discussed during our meetings.  
- The [Workshops folder]() is destined to storage the courses done by our node. 
- The [Articles folder]() contains the articles discussed during the Journal Clubs or recommendations to read.
